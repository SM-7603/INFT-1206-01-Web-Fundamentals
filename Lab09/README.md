# Important Stuff:

> The `head.php` file shouldn't contain the <head>...</head> tags...

Make sure the head tags are in the `index.php` file & only the content in the <head> tags are in the `head.php` file.

> [!important]
> We'll be re-using a lot of the files that we're creating for this Lab 9.

## File structure (*This is just the default -> structure*)

> [!attention]
