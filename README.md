# INFT-1206 Intro to Web Development Repository 🌐

Welcome to the **INFT-1206 Intro to Web Development** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my code, mini-projects, and test solutions completed during the semester. The course covers a variety of web development topics, including SQL, PHP (🐘), HTML, and CSS. The repository is structured with organized folders for easy navigation and access to specific content.

## Repository Structure 📂

Here's a breakdown of the file structure you'll find in this repository:
